#for loop - it used for a range of numbers or character or anything 
#for loop is the best used when we know the range of something
#example let us consider the below code which prints the range of numbers inclusively
for i in range(1,10):
    print(i, end=' ')
print("\n")
#example let us consider the below code which prints the elements of the array 
for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
    print(i, end =' ')
print("\n")
#end here is used to print all the elements in the same line
for i in "hello":
    print(i,end =' ')
print("\n")
# "\n" adds a new line in python
